A widget to make tag clouds out of multiple taxonomies, across multiple post types and control their appearance.

== Description ==

The normal WP Tag Cloud widget only uses one taxonomy at a time, and doesn't handle the default post_tag or category taxonomies being assigned to custom post types.

With this plugin, you can now configure (on a per-widget basis):

* which taxonomies and post types are to be included,
* the size of the smallest and largest tags (in different font units),
* which terms should always be excluded from the cloud,
* the maximum number of tags to show in the cloud,
* how to order the tags - alphabetically or by number of tagged posts (ascending or descending), or just randomly,
* how to treat tags with just one entry - leave alone, remove them or link directly to that post,
* whether to make links no-follow,
* what case the tags should appear as,
* and how long each widget's output should be saved for, if at all.

There are a couple of demonstration styles included, but the plugin is currently intended to be styled by your own theme's stylesheet.
